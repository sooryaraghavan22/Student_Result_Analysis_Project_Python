# Student_Result_Analysis_Project_Python

## Overview
The primary goal is to analyze the factors that influence test scores in a student result analysis project and assess their impact on student's scores.Here we have three types of test scores: MathScore, ReadingScore, and WritingScore.In this project, we have mainly used the Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries.

## Analysis Approach:
* **Data Exploration:** In this phase, I loaded the dataset named 'student_scores.csv' into a Pandas DataFrame and understood the characteristics of the dataset, identifying patterns or relationships that can guide further analysis.
* **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Ensured that the loaded data is in a suitable format for analysis and modeling.
* **Data Analysis:** I have conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), used visualizations (Matplotlib and Seaborn) to explore relationships between variables, and identified any trends or outliers.

## Sample Insights:
* Parents' education, sports practice, weekly study hours, a standard(healthy) food,being the first child and test preparation have a positive impact on students' scores.
* There is no significant impact on students' scores due to their parents' marital status, number of siblings, or transportation.
* Observed one outlier with a value of zero in MathScore, and the maximum number of outliers is in WritingScore.

# Student_Result_Analysis_Project_Python

## Overview
The primary goal is to analyze the factors that influence test scores in a student result analysis project and assess their impact on students' scores.Here we have three types of test scores: MathScore, ReadingScore, and WritingScore.In this project, we have mainly used the Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries.

## Analysis Approach:
* **Data Exploration:** In this phase, I loaded the dataset named 'student_scores.csv' into a Pandas DataFrame and understood the characteristics of the dataset, identifying patterns or relationships that can guide further analysis.
* **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Ensured that the loaded data is in a suitable format for analysis and modeling.
* **Data Analysis:** I have conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), used visualizations (Matplotlib and Seaborn) to explore relationships between variables, and identified any trends or outliers.

# Student_Result_Analysis_Project_Python

## Overview
The primary goal is to analyze the factors that influence test scores in a student result analysis project and assess their impact on students' scores.Here we have three types of test scores: MathScore, ReadingScore, and WritingScore.In this project, we have mainly used the Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries.

## Analysis Approach:
Data Exploration: In this phase, I loaded the dataset named 'student_scores.csv' into a Pandas DataFrame and understood the characteristics of the dataset, identifying patterns or relationships that can guide further analysis.
Data Cleaning and Preparation: The student score data was cleaned and prepared for analysis using Power BI.
SQL Queries: Executed SQL queries to answer specific questions and extract insights.
